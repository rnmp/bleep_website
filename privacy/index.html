        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><em>Last updated: July 13, 2024</em></p>

        <p>
          At Bleep, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring
          the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy
          explains how we handle your data in our iOS and macOS app.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <p>
          Bleep does not collect, store, or process any of your personal
          information on our servers. All your data, including notes,
          bookmarks, and files, is stored locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data Storage and Sync</h2>

        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <p>
          All your Bleep data is primarily stored locally on your device. This
          means that your information remains under your control at all times.
        </p>

        <h3>iCloud Sync</h3>
        <p>
          To provide seamless synchronization between your devices, Bleep uses
          Apple's iCloud service. When you enable iCloud sync:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your Bleep data is encrypted and securely stored in your personal
            iCloud account.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sync process is managed entirely by Apple's iCloud service.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not have access to your iCloud account or the data stored
            within it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please note that the use of iCloud is subject to Apple's own terms of
          service and privacy policy. We encourage you to review Apple's
          privacy practices for more information on how they handle your data.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>

        <p>
          We take reasonable measures to help protect your data within the
          Bleep app:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All data is stored locally on your device, protected by your
            device's built-in security features.
          </li>
          <li>
            When using iCloud sync, your data is protected by Apple's
            encryption standards during transmission and storage.
          </li>
          <li>
            We recommend using strong device passcodes and enabling biometric
            authentication (like Face ID or Touch ID) for additional security.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>
          Bleep does not share your data with any third-party services. The
          only external service used is Apple's iCloud for data
          synchronization, which is optional and under your control.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>
          Bleep is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not
          knowingly collect or maintain information from children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>
          We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
          you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app and
          updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2>

        <p>
          As all your data is stored locally or in your personal iCloud
          account, you have full control over your information. You can view,
          edit, or delete your data at any time within the app.
        </p>
