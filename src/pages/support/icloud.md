2. Make sure you're signed in to iCloud on your device
3. Follow Apple’s official steps to [enable iCloud Drive](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/set-up-icloud-drive-mm203b05aec8/icloud)

- Changes may take a few moments to sync (up to a minute)

### Confirm it's working

1. Open Bleep on your Mac
