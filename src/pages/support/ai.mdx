The Bleep [MCP Server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets your favorite AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) read and search your Bleep data. All without Bleep itself needing to know anything about AI.

## Easy Setup

1. Add the following to [your agent’s config](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "bleep": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["bleep-mcp"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
2. Ask AI some questions! Some examples:
   - _What can you do with Bleep?_
   - _What can you say about me from the rooms I have in Bleep?_
   - _Which from recent notes in Bleep are too vague?_

## Privacy

The MCP server runs **locally on your machine**. Your data never leaves your computer unless you explicitly send it to an AI provider through your client. Bleep itself does not transmit any data to external services.
