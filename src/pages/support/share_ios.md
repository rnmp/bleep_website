## One-time Setup

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Bleep installed.
2. Go to Safari or your favorite browser.
3. Tap on share icon (![share icon](./share_ios/share_icon.png)) on iOS.
4. Tap on More (three dots) &rarr; Edit.
5. Enable Bleep and add it to favorites (so it shows up first!)

## Going Forwardâ€¦

1. You can use this extension anywhere you see that same share icon. It's everywhere, really. But the video above shows it in Safari.
2. Tap on that icon and select Bleep.
3. Your content will be added immediately to Bleep.
